# ProdBot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

ProdBot is a productivity-focused chatbot designed to help users plan their day and week, set goals, create actionable to-do lists, and stay motivated. It provides a simple conversational interface to guide users through staying organized and achieving their tasks.  
**Building AI course project**

## Background

Many people struggle with organizing their time, managing tasks, and staying motivated to complete goals. These challenges affect productivity and well-being.  
I created ProdBot to address these issues by providing an easy-to-use chatbot that helps users:  
* Structure their day and week.  
* Break down goals into manageable tasks.  
* Stay motivated with personalized encouragement.  

This project combines my interest in AI and productivity to create a practical tool that helps improve daily life.  

## How is it used?

Users interact with ProdBot in a conversational manner. Here’s how:  
1. Input tasks or goals for the day or week.  
2. Organize them into structured plans using prompts from ProdBot.  
3. Get motivational messages and reminders to stay on track.  

ProdBot is ideal for:  
* Individuals needing help with time management.  
* People looking to create to-do lists and actionable plans.  
* Anyone who enjoys a motivating digital assistant for their goals.  

## Data sources and AI methods

ProdBot relies on user-provided data (tasks, goals, schedules) for creating plans. For motivation and encouragement, it uses:  
* Predefined motivational quotes and strategies.  
* Basic natural language processing to understand and structure user inputs.  

Future versions may incorporate APIs like:  
[Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar) to sync plans and reminders.  

## Challenges

ProdBot does not address:  
* Complex project management.  
* Automatic detection of overlapping tasks.  

**Ethical considerations**:  
* Data privacy – users’ inputs must be stored securely or not stored at all.  
* Avoid dependency on AI for productivity, encouraging users to develop self-reliant habits.  

## What next?

To enhance ProdBot:  
* Integrate with calendars (Google, Outlook).  
* Improve NLP capabilities for better understanding of inputs.  
* Add voice command support for accessibility.  
Skills needed: advanced NLP, backend development, and app integration expertise.  

## Acknowledgments
